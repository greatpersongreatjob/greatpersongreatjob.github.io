Hey guys, 
It's your CEO here with another overrated company.
Oriens.
The only thing they did is rip out a car's locking mechanism and sell it. However, they still get lots of recognition and praise for their achievement. I also dislike their intruisive advertising and branding.
Thanks for reading etc etc
CEO
